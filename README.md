My name is Connor Campbell. I am a graduate of Gonzaga University and currently work at NAVEX Global, a software company based out of Lake Oswego, OR. I am primarily interested in data analysis, specifically using data to 
investigate public trends and correlative relationships. Most of my experience is with using R, but I also have basic knowledge of Python.
