# US Soccer Attendance Analysis 

## Overview
Using various online data sources, exploratory plotting, and regression analysis I attempted to analyze trends and drivers of soccer attendance in both the MLS and USL, the two highest-level leagues in the United States.  

A full rundown of the project including plotting and analysis can be found [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/connorc267/Connor-Campbell-Portfolio/blob/main/US%20Soccer%20Analysis/READme.html).

## Highlights 

- Web scraping to obtain data
- Cleaning and manipulation of data
- Plotting of data to look for preliminary trends and correlations
- Regression modelling
